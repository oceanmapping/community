# Welcome
Welcome to the Ocean Mapping Community Wiki!

Thank you for contributing your expertise and experience.

As with the rest of the wiki, these Contribution Guidelines are in development to help establish a high degree of relevance and ease-of-use.

In all cases, we seek to follow the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/oceanmapping/community/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and [GitHub Community Guidelines](https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-community-guidelines)

# Scope
It is important to consider the scope of the wiki so its content is relevant and easily maintained.
Suggested topics for [multibeam](https://github.com/oceanmapping/community/wiki#multibeam-topics) and [other systems](https://github.com/oceanmapping/community/wiki#other-mapping-topics) have been added by the first contributors, highlighting some areas of common interest.

The intent is to point users, new and expert, toward the most helpful and up-to-date resources so they can make informed decisions about installation, operation, and processing.  It is not meant to be prescriptive for any particular system or insist on any 'one size fits all' approach.  

Content should:
1. **Apply broadly** for mapping operations
1. **Highlight examples** of successful use cases
    1. Show us how you did it!
1. **Discuss limitations** or caveats of an approach
1. **Protect** IT security and sensitive information
1. **Respect** the expertise of others and differences among programs

Troubleshooting steps are also of interest for solving common issues.

# Adding and editing content
## Through GitHub
Please [contact us](https://github.com/oceanmapping/community/wiki#contact-us) to be added as a GitHub collaborator.

1. Review the existing topics to see where your content fits.
1. Whenever possible, expand on existing topics and add sub-topics to existing pages.
    1. As the site grows, we will reorganize as necessary to improve clarity or context.
1. Add or edit content directly with the GitHub wiki editing features
    1. Check out GitHub's quick guides for [adding or editing wiki pages](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/documenting-your-project-with-wikis/adding-or-editing-wiki-pages) and [basic syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) to get started
1. Images require URLs; upload images from your computer to the wiki repository (Code --> Add file) to generate a URL
1. Wherever possible, link to resources (e.g., SOPs) hosted by others rather than uploading separate copies to the repository
    1. This will simplify updates as new versions of these documents are released

Remember this is new for many of us and we are excited for your contributions!
